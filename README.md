# TsallisHEP

Studying the properties of the produced charged particles through different proton-proton and nuclease-nucleus collisions using The Tsallis’ distribution function by fitting the transverse momentum distributions of the produced charged particles to extract thermodynamic parameters such as chemical potential, non-equilibrium factor, and the average temperature at the kinetic freeze-out stage. in the following reactions;

1-Proton-Proton collisions:

The transverse momentum distributions of the produced charged hadrons through proton-proton collision at different energies = 0.9,
2.36, 7 Tev at Mid-rapidity range.

2- Nucluse-nucluse collisions(Xe-Xe):

The transverse momentum distributions of the produced charged
hadrons through different A-A collisions at different energies in the TeV region at The rapidity range.


Disclaimer: 

The data of charged particles produced in proton-proton and Nucluse-nucleus collisions are extracted from the Durham particle data group (PDG):
