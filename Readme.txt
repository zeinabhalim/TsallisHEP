Project desecribtion:

Studying the properties of the produced charged particles through different proton-proton and nucluse-nucluse collisions using The Tsallis’ distribution  function that describes the thermal fluctuation of the system in the following reactions;

1-Proton-Proton collisions:

The transverse momentum distributions of the produced charged hadrons through proton-proton collision at different energies = 0.9,
2.36, 7 Tev at Mid rapidity range.

2- Nucluse-nucluse collisions(Xe-Xe):

The transverse momentum distributions of the produced charged
hadrons through different A-A collision at different energies in the TeV region at Mid rapidity range.



By fitting those transverse momentum distributions of the produced charged particles with the tsallis models, it was possible to extract thermodynamic
parameters such as chemical potential, non-equilibrium factor, and the average temperature at the kinetic freeze-out stage. Aiming to investigate the phase transition from hadronic to Quark-Gluon Plasma state (QGP) by relating the change in the macroscopic variables such as transverse momentum, multiplicity distribution to the microscopic hypothesis of the transition mechanism.

The data of charged particles produced in proton-proton and Nucluse-nucluse collisions are extracted from the Durham particle data group (PDG):
